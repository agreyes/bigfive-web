He\nsuggested that everyone shows some signs of neurosis, but that we\ndiffer in our degree of suffering and our specific symptoms of\ndistress. Today neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience\nnegative feelings. <br /><br />Those who score high on Neuroticism may\nexperience primarily one specific negative feeling such as anxiety,\nanger, or depression, but are likely to experience several of these\nemotions. <br /><br />People high in neuroticism are emotionally reactive. They\nrespond emotionally to events that would not affect most people, and\ntheir reactions tend to be more intense than normal. They are more\nlikely to interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and minor\nfrustrations as hopelessly difficult. <br /><br />Their negative emotional\nreactions tend to persist for unusually long periods of time, which\nmeans they are often in a bad mood. These problems in emotional\nregulation can diminish a neurotic's ability to think clearly, make\ndecisions, and cope effectively with stress.","scoreText":"low","count":24,"score":69,"facets":[{"facet":1,"title":"Anxiety","text":"The \"fight-or-flight\" system of the brain of anxious\nindividuals is too easily and too often engaged. Therefore, people who\nare high in anxiety often feel like something dangerous is about to happen.\nThey may be afraid of specific situations or be just generally fearful.\nThey feel tense, jittery, and nervous. Persons low in Anxiety are generally\ncalm and fearless.","score":15,"count":4,"scoreText":"high"},{"facet":2,"title":"Anger","text":"Persons who score high in Anger feel enraged when\nthings do not go their way. They are sensitive about being treated fairly\nand feel resentful and bitter when they feel they are being cheated.\nThis scale measures the tendency to feel angry; whether or not the\nperson expresses annoyance and hostility depends on the individual's\nlevel on Agreeableness. Low scorers do not get angry often or easily.","score":14,"count":4,"scoreText":"high"},{"facet":3,"title":"Depression","text":"This scale measures the tendency to feel sad, dejected,\nand discouraged. High scorers lack energy and have difficult initiating\nactivities. Low scorers tend to be free from these depressive feelings.","score":9,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":4,"title":"Self-Consciousness","text":"Self-conscious individuals are sensitive\nabout what others think of them. Their concern about rejection and\nridicule cause them to feel shy and uncomfortable abound others. They\nare easily embarrassed and often feel ashamed. Their fears that others\nwill criticize or make fun of them are exaggerated and unrealistic, but\ntheir awkwardness and discomfort may make these fears a self-fulfilling\nprophecy. Low scorers, in contrast, do not suffer from the mistaken\nimpression that everyone is watching and judging them. They do not feel\nnervous in social situations.","score":11,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":5,"title":"Immoderation","text":"Immoderate individuals feel strong cravings and\nurges that they have have difficulty resisting. They tend to be\noriented toward short-term pleasures and rewards rather than long-\nterm consequences. Low scorers do not experience strong, irresistible\ncravings and consequently do not find themselves tempted to overindulge.","score":7,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":6,"title":"Vulnerability","text":"High scorers on Vulnerability experience\npanic, confusion, and helplessness when under pressure or stress.\nLow scorers feel more poised, confident, and clear-thinking when\nstressed.","score":13,"count":4,"scoreText":"high"}],"text":"Your score on Neuroticism is low, indicating that you are\nexceptionally calm, composed and unflappable.

They tend to be enthusiastic,\naction-oriented, individuals who are likely to say \"Yes!\" or \"Let's\ngo!\" to opportunities for excitement. In groups they like to talk,\nassert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.\n<br /><br />\nIntroverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of\nextraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and\ndisengaged from the social world. Their lack of social involvement\nshould not be interpreted as shyness or depression; the\nintrovert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert and prefers\nto be alone. <br /><br />The independence and reserve of the introvert is\nsometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or arrogance. In reality, an\nintrovert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension will not\nseek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached.","scoreText":"low","count":24,"score":71,"facets":[{"facet":1,"title":"Friendliness","text":"Friendly people genuinely like other people\nand openly demonstrate positive feelings toward others. They make\nfriends quickly and it is easy for them to form close, intimate\nrelationships. Low scorers on Friendliness are not necessarily cold\nand hostile, but they do not reach out to others and are perceived\nas distant and reserved.","score":10,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":2,"title":"Gregariousness","text":"Gregarious people find the company of\nothers pleasantly stimulating and rewarding. They enjoy the\nexcitement of crowds. Low scorers tend to feel overwhelmed by, and\ntherefore actively avoid, large crowds. They do not necessarily\ndislike being with people sometimes, but their need for privacy and\ntime to themselves is much greater than for individuals who score\nhigh on this scale.","score":8,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":3,"title":"Assertiveness","text":"High scorers Assertiveness like to speak\n out, take charge, and direct the activities of others.

Persons who score high on this scale typically\nexperience a range of positive feelings, including happiness,\nenthusiasm, optimism, and joy. Low scorers are not as prone to such\nenergetic, high spirits.","score":13,"count":4,"scoreText":"high"}],"text":"Your score on Extraversion is low, indicating you are\nintroverted, reserved, and quiet. You enjoy solitude and solitary\nactivities. Your socializing tends to be restricted to a few close friends."},{"domain":"O","title":"Openness To Experience","shortDescription":"Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people.","description":"Open people are intellectually curious,\nappreciative of art, and sensitive to beauty. They tend to be,\ncompared to closed people, more aware of their feelings. They tend to\nthink and act in individualistic and nonconforming\nways. Intellectuals typically score high on Openness to Experience;\nconsequently, this factor has also been called Culture or\nIntellect. <br /><br />Nonetheless, Intellect is probably best regarded as one aspect of openness\nto experience. Scores on Openness to Experience are only modestly\nrelated to years of education and scores on standard intelligent tests.\n<br /><br />\nAnother characteristic of the open cognitive style is a facility for thinking\nin symbols and abstractions far removed from concrete experience. Depending on\nthe individual's specific intellectual abilities, this symbolic cognition may\ntake the form of mathematical, logical, or geometric thinking, artistic and\nmetaphorical use of language, music composition or performance, or one of the\nmany visual or performing arts.\n<br /><br />\nPeople with low scores on openness to experience tend to have narrow, common\ninterests. They prefer the plain, straightforward, and obvious over the\ncomplex, ambiguous, and subtle. They may regard the arts and sciences with\nsuspicion, regarding these endeavors as abstruse or of no practical use.\nClosed people prefer familiarity over novelty; they are conservative and\nresistant to change.\n<br /><br />\nOpenness is often presented as healthier or more mature by psychologists, who\nare often themselves open to experience. However, open and closed styles of\nthinking are useful in different environments. The intellectual style of the\nopen person may serve a professor well, but research has shown that closed\nthinking is related to superior job performance in police work, sales, and\na number of service occupations.","scoreText":"low","count":24,"score":69,"facets":[{"facet":1,"title":"Imagination","text":"To imaginative individuals, the real world is\noften too plain and ordinary. High scorers on this scale use fantasy as a\nway of creating a richer, more interesting world. Low scorers are on this\nscale are more oriented to facts than fantasy.","score":12,"count":4,"scoreText":"neutral"},{"facet":2,"title":"Artistic Interests","text":"High scorers on this scale love beauty, both in\nart and in nature. They become easily involved and absorbed in artistic\nand natural events. They are not necessarily artistically trained nor\ntalented, although many will be. The defining features of this scale are\ninterest in, and appreciation of natural and\nartificial beauty. Low scorers lack aesthetic sensitivity and interest in\nthe arts.","score":12,"count":4,"scoreText":"neutral"},{"facet":3,"title":"Emotionality","text":"Persons high on Emotionality have good access\nto and awareness of their own feelings. Low scorers are less aware of\ntheir feelings and tend not to express their emotions openly.","score":11,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":4,"title":"Adventurousness","text":"High scorers on adventurousness are eager to\ntry new activities, travel to foreign lands, and experience different\nthings. They find familiarity and routine boring, and will take a new\nroute home just because it is different. Low scorers tend to feel\nuncomfortable with change and prefer familiar routines.","score":12,"count":4,"scoreText":"neutral"},{"facet":5,"title":"Intellect","text":"Intellect and artistic interests are the two most\nimportant, central aspects of openness to experience. High scorers on\nIntellect love to play with ideas. They are open-minded to new and unusual\nideas, and like to debate intellectual issues. They enjoy riddles, puzzles,\nand brain teasers. Low scorers on Intellect prefer dealing with either\npeople or things rather than ideas. They regard intellectual exercises as a\nwaste of time. Intellect should not be equated with intelligence.\nIntellect is an intellectual style, not an intellectual ability, although\nhigh scorers on Intellect score slightly higher than low-Intellect\nindividuals on standardized intelligence tests.","score":11,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":6,"title":"Liberalism","text":"Psychological liberalism refers to a readiness to\nchallenge authority, convention, and traditional values. In its most\nextreme form, psychological liberalism can even represent outright\nhostility toward rules, sympathy for law-breakers, and love of ambiguity,\nchaos, and disorder. Psychological conservatives prefer the security and\nstability brought by conformity to tradition. Psychological liberalism\nand conservatism are not identical to political affiliation, but certainly\nincline individuals toward certain political parties.","score":11,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"}],"text":"Your score on Openness to Experience is low, indicating you like to think in\nplain and simple terms.

Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.","description":"They are therefore considerate, friendly,\ngenerous, helpful, and willing to compromise their interests with\nothers'. Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human\nnature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and\ntrustworthy. <br /><br />\nDisagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with\nothers.  They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and\ntherefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people.\nSometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be\nsuspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.\n<br /><br />\nAgreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining\npopularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable\npeople. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations\nthat require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable\npeople can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.","scoreText":"low","count":24,"score":69,"facets":[{"facet":1,"title":"Trust","text":"A person with high trust assumes that most people\nare fair, honest, and have good intentions. Persons low in trust\nsee others as selfish, devious, and potentially dangerous.","score":15,"count":4,"scoreText":"high"},{"facet":2,"title":"Morality","text":"High scorers on this scale see no need for\npretense or manipulation when dealing with others and are therefore\ncandid, frank, and sincere. Low scorers believe that a certain\namount of deception in social relationships is necessary. People\nfind it relatively easy to relate to the straightforward\nhigh-scorers on this scale. They generally find it more difficult\nto relate to the unstraightforward low-scorers on this scale. It\nshould be made clear that low scorers are not unprincipled\nor immoral; they are simply more guarded and less willing to openly\nreveal the whole truth.","score":9,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":3,"title":"Altruism","text":"Altruistic people find helping other people\ngenuinely rewarding. Consequently, they are generally willing to\nassist those who are in need. Altruistic people find that doing\nthings for others is a form of self-fulfillment rather than\nself-sacrifice. Low scorers on this scale do not particularly like\nhelping those in need. Requests for help feel like an imposition\nrather than an opportunity for self-fulfillment.","score":12,"count":4,"scoreText":"neutral"},{"facet":4,"title":"Cooperation","text":"Individuals who score high on this scale\ndislike confrontations. They are perfectly willing to compromise or\nto deny their own needs in order to get along with others. Those\nwho score low on this scale are more likely to intimidate others to\nget their way.","score":11,"count":4,"scoreText":"low"},{"facet":5,"title":"Modesty","text":"High scorers on this scale do not like to claim\nthat they are better than other people. In some cases this attitude\nmay derive from low self-confidence or self-esteem. Nonetheless,\nsome people with high self-esteem find immodesty unseemly.

They feel the pain of others\nvicariously and are easily moved to pity. Low scorers are not\naffected strongly by human suffering.

People see you as tough,\ncritical, and uncompromising."},{"domain":"C","title":"Conscientiousness","shortDescription":"Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.","description":"Impulses are not inherently bad;\noccasionally time constraints require a snap decision, and acting on\nour first impulse can be an effective response. Also, in times of\nplay rather than work, acting spontaneously and impulsively can be\nfun. Impulsive individuals can be seen by others as colorful,\nfun-to-be-with, and zany.\n<br /><br />\nNonetheless, acting on impulse can lead to trouble in a number of\nways. Some impulses are antisocial. Uncontrolled antisocial acts\nnot only harm other members of society, but also can result in\nretribution toward the perpetrator of such impulsive acts. Another\nproblem with impulsive acts is that they often produce immediate\nrewards but undesirable, long-term consequences. Examples include\nexcessive socializing that leads to being fired from one's job,\nhurling an insult that causes the breakup of an important\nrelationship, or using pleasure-inducing drugs that eventually\ndestroy one's health.\n<br /><br />\nImpulsive behavior, even when not seriously destructive, diminishes\na person's effectiveness in significant ways. Acting impulsively\ndisallows contemplating alternative courses of action, some of which\nwould have been wiser than the impulsive choice. Impulsivity also\nsidetracks people during projects that require organized sequences\nof steps or stages. Accomplishments of an impulsive person are\ntherefore small, scattered, and inconsistent.\n<br /><br />\nA hallmark of intelligence, what potentially separates human beings\nfrom earlier life forms, is the ability to think about future\nconsequences before acting on an impulse. Intelligent activity\ninvolves contemplation of long-range goals, organizing and planning\nroutes to these goals, and persisting toward one's goals in the face\nof short-lived impulses to the contrary. The idea that intelligence\ninvolves impulse control is nicely captured by the term prudence, an\nalternative label for the Conscientiousness domain. Prudent means\nboth wise and cautious.\n<br /><br/>\nPersons who score high on the\nConscientiousness scale are, in fact, perceived by others as intelligent.\nThe benefits of high conscientiousness are obvious. Conscientious\nindividuals avoid trouble and achieve high levels of success through\npurposeful planning and persistence. They are also positively\nregarded by others as intelligent and reliable. On the negative\nside, they can be compulsive perfectionists and workaholics.\nFurthermore, extremely conscientious individuals might be regarded\nas stuffy and boring.\n<br /><br />\nUnconscientious people may be criticized for\ntheir unreliability, lack of ambition, and failure to stay within\nthe lines, but they will experience many short-lived pleasures and\nthey will never be called stuffy.","scoreText":"high","count":24,"score":76,"facets":[{"facet":1,"title":"Self-Efficacy","text":"Self-Efficacy describes confidence in one's ability\nto accomplish things. High scorers believe they have the intelligence\n(common sense), drive, and self-control necessary for achieving success.\nLow scorers do not feel effective, and may have a sense that they are not\nin control of their lives.","score":16,"count":4,"scoreText":"high"},{"facet":2,"title":"Orderliness","text":"Persons with high scores on orderliness are\nwell-organized.
